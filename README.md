# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Maricarmen Frias Prieto**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://boulder-stone-warrior.glitch.me

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_random.asp to figure out how to randomly create a pattern everytime the game is created.
I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ to figure out the syntax of javascript.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I was never exposed to coding in high school up until my senior year. I had enrolled in AP Computer Science in hopes to learn how to code in a language. We used the Snap! Software that allowed us to compose code using premade blocks. It was fairly easy and since that is all I had ever been exposed to, I thought that’s how coding worked. It was not until my first year of college that I took an introduction to programming with Python and experienced the reality of coding. From there on, I continued the process of learning to code and experienced using C and C++. One of the biggest challenges while submitting this project was that I was not familiar with the languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The logic and some syntax of C++ and Javascript are very alike yet so different. For example, the for loops are practically similar except for the “let” word before initiating the i variable. I am very glad I have had some experience with other languages to apply what I have learned so far to other languages that I may not be familiar with. In order to overcome this difficulty, I referred back to the reference provided and googled some of the syntax to fully understand what the functions were doing. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Some questions I have are: How do companies allow users to create accounts on websites and store that information privately? Does HTML offer some sort of “make file” like C++ when using multiple files? My assumption is that writing code for one big website is not done under one file (it would be too many lines of code).

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time working on this project, I would want to make a level system. In other words, as the player advances in levels the game speeds up and becomes harder. I would want to start level 1 with four buttons then as the levels progress I would like to add a button; level 2 would have 5 buttons and so on. I would also like to create a more captivating home screen. Since I do have design experience, I would like to create my own icons and figures. For example, creating a logo and better game title would be more beneficial.
